Back in the day, GIFS were the preferred image format on the web. This was mainly because they were compatible with all browsers, could be made transparent (remember those 1 pixel transparent gif spacers?), and could also hold multiple frames - creating an animated effect.
Animated GIFS are still quite useful and the increase in Internet speeds has helped their popularity because animated gifs can quickly become large files. 

The other great thing about animated gifs is that they are less intrusive than videos. People are wary of hitting 'play' on a video when they are in a public place or at work, whereas a gif is usually less of a commitment.
Recently, new technology has given rise to a new trend - CINEMAGRAPHS.

What are cinemagraphs?
They are a mixture of a still image and animation. 
A picture tells a thousand words:
<div style="position:relative; height:0; padding-bottom:66.67%; width:100%"><iframe style="position:absolute; top:0; left:0; width:100%; height:100%;" src="https://media.flixel.com/cinemagraph/eo6belccvpwhvgoc9bjj?hd=false&forceGif=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<div style="position:relative; height:0; padding-bottom:56.25%; width:100%"><iframe style="position:absolute; top:0; left:0; width:100%; height:100%;" src="https://media.flixel.com/cinemagraph/qg9ikph2s2ipkda3th2x?hd=false&forceGif=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
